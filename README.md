# Chest and Breast Classification

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for medical image classification. The tasks involve working with 2D breast ultrasound images (BreastMNIST) and 3D chest CT images (NoduleMNIST3D) from the MedMNIST dataset. The primary goal is to gain familiarity with loading datasets, data visualization, implementing CNN models, training, and evaluating the models.
